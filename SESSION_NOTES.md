# Phase 3 session notes — image-driven bar-relative rhythm/density

Branch `feature/image-contour`. Baseline was `31d2c21` (Phase-2 pitch-blend
spike). Three commits added on top:

- `df3f371` Stage 1: bar-position clock derived from the real timeline
- `875fa70` Stage 2: image contour → pre-flatten density hook
- (this commit) Stage 3: verification pass + permanent regression tests

All work is confined to the Phrased-mode path in `src/melody/MelodyGenerator.cpp`
(+ one new `MelodyOptions` field in the header). Freeform, Arp, and Chord paths
are untouched.

## What changed

### Stage 1 — bar clock (`barAlignedDuration`)
The old rhythm cursor (`rhythmCursor_`) walked one monotonic index through the
session groove: it never reset at bar lines, ignored rests/ornaments, and was
not advanced by copied A′ phrases, so the "one-bar groove" drifted out of
alignment. Replaced the *emitted* duration source with `barAlignedDuration(beat,
template)`, which tiles the groove against each note's **real** start beat (the
flatten-loop accumulator, which already folds in rests and ornaments) using the
same `lround(beat*960)` quantization as strong-beat detection. The template now
restarts on every downbeat and re-aligns after any offset.

Inter-phrase rests are snapped to the half-beat grid so phrase starts stay on
groove boundaries and everything lands on integer 960-ticks.

### Stage 2 — density (`applyImageDensity` + flatten split)
New `MelodyOptions::imageRhythmAmount` (in `[0,1]`, **default 0**). Above 0, each
templated note's `localContrast` (brightness range over its 8-neighbour cell
window, wrapped) scales to 1–4 equal subdivisions of its bar-aligned length.
Busy/edgy image regions get denser rhythm; flat regions stay long. The split is
applied only while pieces stay exact integer 960-ticks and no finer than 1/64.

## Assumptions / decisions (reversible)

1. **Kept `rhythmCursor_`/`nextDuration()` as the pass-1 walk clock.** The walk
   still advances `localBeat_`/`harmonyBeat_` by the cursor durations, so the
   pass-1 pitch trajectory (and the whole RNG stream) is byte-identical to
   baseline. Only the *emitted* durations moved to the bar clock. Consequence:
   Phrased **pitches** shift slightly vs `31d2c21` because pass 2 re-evaluates
   strong-beat chord snaps against the new bar-aligned timeline. This is the
   intended Phase-3 behavioural change; no test pins Phrased pitches. Fully
   ripping out the two-clock split is the deeper bug-4b work, **deferred to
   Phase 4** (per the roadmap close-out).

2. **Density defaults OFF (`imageRhythmAmount = 0`).** This makes Stage 2 a
   byte-exact no-op on all existing callers/tests and keeps the RNG stream
   identical, so the plugin can opt in later. **Follow-up:** wire this to a
   "Density"/"Image Rhythm" APVTS param in the host plugin (parent Lumen repo).
   The parent still compiles unchanged because the field is defaulted.

3. **Subdivisions are unison rhythmic repeats**, marked non-eligible so pass 2
   and the diagnostics skip them (they keep the parent note's pitch). Total time
   is conserved (a note of length D becomes N notes of D/N).

4. **Rests snapped to the 0.5 grid** (were scaled by an energy factor to
   arbitrary values). Musically negligible, keeps the whole timeline on-grid.
   `test_phrased_rests_between_phrases` still passes (min rest 0.5 > 0).

5. **Density maps contrast→1..4 pieces** because 2/3/4 all divide every groove
   length (0.5/1.0/1.5/2.0 beats = 480/960/1440/1920 ticks) cleanly on the 960
   grid. Merging low-contrast notes into *longer* ones (the other half of
   "smooth = longer") was **not** implemented — flat regions simply stay at the
   groove length. A reasonable future refinement.

## Verification (Stage 3) — all PASS

Run via `LumenaTests` (permanent) plus a throwaway harness
(`scratchpad/verify.cpp`, not committed):

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Grid alignment (5 energies × 4 amounts × 3 images × 50 seeds = 3000 melodies) | 0 off-grid notes |
| Total length == whole bars, ≥ loopBars (960 cases, loopBars ∈ {1,2,4,8}, density on/off) | 0 wrong |
| RNG parity — density draws 0 RNG (post-gen mt19937 state identical across amount 0/0.5/1.0, 540 cases) | 0 diverged |
| Determinism — same seed ⇒ same MIDI (180 cases) | 0 nondeterministic |
| Density fires on busy image (checkerboard) | 60/60 seeds denser |
| **Baseline diff** vs `31d2c21` (built in a worktree): Freeform byte-for-byte; Phrased post-gen RNG state | **identical** |

Permanent regression tests added to `MelodyGeneratorTests.cpp`:
`test_phrased_image_density` (on-grid, in-scale, time-conserving, flat=no-op,
busy=denser) and `test_image_density_draws_no_rng` (seed stream intact).
Full suite: **15321/15321 green.**

## Build / test (WSL, headless)

```
cmake --build build-wsl --target LumenaTests
./build-wsl/bin/LumenaTests
```

(g++ 15 emits one pre-existing `-Wfree-nonheap-object` false positive from
`varyMotif`'s inlined vector copy — documented at that call site, not from Phase
3, and not an error under the WSL flags.)

## Plugin wiring (Density param) — added after Stage 3

`imageRhythmAmount` is now a real plugin parameter in the parent Lumen repo
(these changes live in the PARENT, not this submodule):

- `Source/State/Parameters.h` — new id `melodyDensity`; `kStateVersion` bumped
  2 → 3 (inert — no migration logic keys off it; per repo convention a melody
  param change bumps it).
- `Source/State/Parameters.cpp` — `FloatParam "Melody Density"`, **range 0..1
  (`unitRange`), default 0.0**, `unitAttr` — identical to the other four macros
  (Energy/Complexity/Image Influence/Repetition). No audio-rate smoothing: like
  the sibling macros it is read once at `generate()` time, not in `processBlock`.
- `Source/Melody/MelodyController.cpp` — `optionsFromParams` maps
  `melodyDensity → MelodyOptions::imageRhythmAmount`.
- `Tools/Tests/TestsMain.cpp` — new `MelodyDensityWiringTest` (category "Melody"):
  drives the real `MelodyController::generate()` on a high-contrast test image and
  checks Density 0 defaults/no-ops deterministically, Density 1 emits strictly
  more notes, and returning to 0 restores the baseline count.
- `CMakeLists.txt` — `lumen_tests` now compiles `MelodyState.cpp`,
  `MelodyPlayer.cpp` and the `MelodyController.cpp` bridge and links
  `Lumena::Lumena` (the bridge stays out of the strict `/W4 /WX` pass, mirroring
  the plugin target).

No-op guarantee survives the wiring: default 0 ⇒ `imageRhythmAmount = 0` ⇒ the
engine's byte-exact groove-only path. Existing patches (which never set
`melodyDensity`) load it at its 0 default, so they are unchanged.

**Verification:** parent `lumen_tests` (built headless under WSL via `build-linux`)
— the new wiring test passes; the only failing test is the pre-existing
`wavetable SHA-256 matches the pinned reference` (a Lens/wavetable golden pinned
on the Windows toolchain; Linux FP differs — unrelated to this work, untouched).

### Follow-up NOT done here (needs the Windows GUI toolchain)
- **UI knob in `Source/UI/MelodyPanel.cpp`.** The four macro knobs share one row
  split into fixed widths (`resized()`, ~L405-408); adding a "DENSITY" knob means
  re-dividing that row 4 → 5 and fitting a longer label. CLAUDE.md requires a
  `Lumen.exe --screenshot` inspection after any UI change, which can't run under
  WSL, so I did not ship unverified layout. The parameter is still fully usable at
  runtime via host automation and is persisted in state/presets. Adding the knob
  is a small, well-scoped Phase-5 task (declare `densityKnob`, construct like the
  others with label "DENSITY", change `kw` to width/5, add one `setBounds`).

## Before/after samples (Phase 3 density)

Short 8-bar MIDI clips, **same seed (2024)**, same checkerboard (high-contrast)
image, 110 BPM, A-minor-pentatonic — only Density changes, everything else fixed.
Saved to `C:\Users\pixel\Projects\lumen\samples\phase3-density\`
(`/mnt/c/Users/pixel/Projects/lumen/samples/phase3-density/`):

| File | Density | Notes / 8 bars | Demonstrates |
|------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| `density-00-baseline.mid` | 0.0 | 37 | Groove-only baseline (feature off) |
| `density-05-mid.mid`      | 0.5 | 103 | Busy regions start subdividing |
| `density-10-high.mid`     | 1.0 | 136 | Full image-driven density |

All three are exactly 8 bars — density subdivides within the bar grid, it does
not change the length. **WAV/MP3 rendering:** no soundfont/renderer is installed
in this environment, so only the MIDI clips are provided; render them through any
soundfont (e.g. `fluidsynth -F out.wav sf2 density-*.mid`) on your end to audition.

## Where the next session picks up

- Phase 3 remaining roadmap items **not** done here: multi-bar (2/4-bar) +
  pickup/cadence templates; region-level phrase contour (rising brightness ⇒
  phrase ascends); folding `style + energy + complexity + image detail` into one
  template chooser. `pickRhythmTemplate` and `barAlignedDuration` are the hooks —
  `barAlignedDuration` already tiles by the template's own period, so a longer
  (multi-bar) template drops in without further timeline changes.
- Wire `imageRhythmAmount` into the plugin UI (Phase 5 surface).
- Bug-4b (unify the `localBeat_`/`harmonyBeat_` walk clock with the real beat so
  pass 1 needs no pass-2 reconciliation) remains deferred to Phase 4.
